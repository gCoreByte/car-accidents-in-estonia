Project D16: Traffic accidents with sustained injuries in Estonia (2011-2021)
---

Team: Anna Maria Tammin, Robert Raul Matsar, Martin Hans Keskk√ºla

Dataset 1 (7.66 MB): A collection of traffic accidents in Estonia, with case number, participants, location, date and time[1].

The plan is to visualise accidents in such a way that it would be possible to understand when and where the risk of sustaining injuries is the highest.

Goal 1: Find out on which dates it is the most dangerous to drive. Compare with national holidays[2].

Goal 2: Generate a heatmap of accidents over Estonia according to time of day and weekday.

Goal 3: Predict the amount of deaths based on the circumstances of the accident.
